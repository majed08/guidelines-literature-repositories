Introduction
============

Aim
---
The OpenAIRE Guidelines for institutional and thematic Repository Managers 4.0 provide
orientation for repository managers to define and implement their local data
management policies according to the requirements of the `OpenAIRE - Open Access
Infrastructure for Research in Europe <http://www.openaire.eu>`_.

The OpenAIRE Guidelines were established to support the `Open Access strategy of the European Commission <http://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=openaccess>`_
and to meet requirements of the OpenAIRE infrastructure.
This new version of the Guidelines, according to the expansion of the aims of the
OpenAIRE initiative and its infrastructure, has a broader scope. In fact, these
Guidelines are intended to guide repository manager to expose to the OpenAIRE
infrastructure **open access and non-open access publications** together with **funding information**, where applicable.

By implementing these Guidelines, repository managers will not only be
enabling authors who deposit publications in their repository to fulfill the EC
Open Access requirements, and eventually also the requirements of other
(national or international) funders with whom OpenAIRE cooperates,
but also incorporating their publications into the OpenAIRE infrastructure for
discoverability and utilizing value-added services provided by the OpenAIRE portal.

The OpenAIRE Guidelines for institutional and thematic Repository Managers 4.0 are 
part of a set of OpenAIRE Guidelines that also include the OpenAIRE Guidelines
for Data Archive Managers, the OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS managers, the OpenAIRE Guidelines for Software Repository Managers, and the Guidelines for Other Research Products Repository Managers.

What's new
----------
In comparison with previous versions of the Guidelines, this version introduces
the following major changes:

* covering of FAIR principles elements
* proof of concept: enhancement of provenance information of with repositoryId's and repositoryName's for Aggregators
* an application profile and schema based on Dublin Core and DataCite incl. a new OAI-metadataPrefix
* support of identifier schemes for authors, organizations, funders, scholarly resources
* introduction of COAR Controlled Vocabularies
* compliance with the `OpenAIRE Content Acquisition Policy <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1446407>`_, published on 05-Oct-2018.

How this document is structured
-------------------------------

Chapter two provides a brief overview of how to configure and use OAI-PMH for OpenAIRE metadata harvesting.
Chapter three describes the application profile.
It assignes properties from Dublin Core and DataCite metadata schemes to OpenAIRE fields.
Each OpenAIRE field is described in detail by

* the name of the field
* how it is mapped to an element in such metadata schemes
* the cardinality of the field
* definition and usage instructions with regard to allowed values in properties, sub-properties and attributes
* example(s)
