The FAIR maturity model: specification and guidelines of the `Research Data Alliance (RDA) <https://www.rd-alliance.org>`_ (DOI: `10.15497/rda00045 <https://doi.org/10.15497/rda00045>`_)
has the aim to specify the objective indicators for the FAIR assessment. The guidelines are intended to assist evaluators to implement the indicators in the evaluation approach or tool 
they manage.
